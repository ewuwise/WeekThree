# Burn Mechanics Explained

## Multi-Chain Burns
- **Burn $BMT on Multiple Chains**: 
  - Ethereum
  - Sui
  - Solana
- **Deflationary Sync**: All burns across chains contribute to a unified supply reduction.

## Mint-to-Burn Economy
- **Real-World Assets (RWAs)**: 
  - Each RWA minted (e.g., uranium, bonds, real estate) triggers a burn of $BMT.
- **Evolving NFTs**: 
  - "Ash NFTs" gain rarity as more $BMT is burned.

## Institutional-Grade Deflation
- **AI-Adjusted Burn Rates**: 
  - 3% during bear markets
  - 8% during bull markets
- **High Throughput**: 
  - Suiâ€™s 250K TPS ensures burns never congest the chain.

## Gamified Scarcity
- **Burn Battles**: 
  - Compete to destroy $BMT and win ultra-rare NFTs.
- **Twitch Integration**: 
  - Streamers earn burn multipliers for viewers.
